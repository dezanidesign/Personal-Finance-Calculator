Tasked with creating a finance calculator using vanilla JS this is my first attempt at the task.

This was definetly tricky for a few reasons. 

The first was being relatively new to javascript there was a lot to learn / unpack with this assignment.

Second some of the instructions seemed a bit vague, was difficult to know if I was on the right track.

The main area of difficulty however was the maths, to say maths isn't my strong suit would be an understatement. However now I know it will be required at certain points I will brush up on it. Fun project that I will be re attempting over the holidays, however definetly challenging.
